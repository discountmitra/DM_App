# üöÄ Production Deployment Guide - Discount Mitra App

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Network Security Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Added `network_security_config.xml` for Android production builds
- ‚úÖ Configured `usesCleartextTraffic: false` for security
- ‚úÖ Added proper HTTPS-only configuration

### 2. **Enhanced CORS Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Updated backend CORS to support mobile app origins
- ‚úÖ Added proper headers for mobile app requests
- ‚úÖ Configured credentials support

### 3. **API Request Wrapper**
- ‚úÖ Created enhanced `apiRequest` function with better error handling
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Improved error messages for production

### 4. **EAS Build Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Added `eas.json` for proper production builds
- ‚úÖ Configured Android AAB and iOS archive builds

## üîß IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Changes
```bash
cd backend
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS and network security for production"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Build and Deploy Mobile App
```bash
cd mobile

# Install EAS CLI if not already installed
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Build for production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### Step 3: Test Production Build
1. Download the AAB file from EAS
2. Install on a physical Android device
3. Test login and API calls
4. Check logs using the NetworkDebugger component

## üêõ DEBUGGING PRODUCTION ISSUES

### Add NetworkDebugger to Your App
Add this to any screen to debug network issues:

```tsx
import NetworkDebugger from '../components/NetworkDebugger';

// In your component
<NetworkDebugger />
```

### Check Logs
- Use `console.log` statements (they work in production builds)
- Check device logs using `adb logcat` for Android
- Use Expo's logging service for remote debugging

## üîç COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: API Calls Still Failing
**Solution:**
- Check if backend is deployed with new CORS settings
- Verify HTTPS certificate is valid
- Test with NetworkDebugger component

### Issue 2: CORS Errors
**Solution:**
- Ensure backend has the updated CORS configuration
- Check that mobile app is using the correct origin
- Verify all headers are properly configured

### Issue 3: Network Security Policy Errors
**Solution:**
- Ensure `network_security_config.xml` is included in build
- Check that `usesCleartextTraffic: false` is set
- Verify all requests use HTTPS

## üì± ANDROID SPECIFIC FIXES

### Network Security Config
The `network_security_config.xml` file ensures:
- Only HTTPS connections are allowed
- Proper certificate validation
- Security for production builds

### App.json Configuration
Updated Android configuration includes:
- Proper network security settings
- Cleartext traffic disabled
- Network security config reference

## üöÄ PRODUCTION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Backend deployed with new CORS settings
- [ ] EAS build configuration created
- [ ] Network security config added
- [ ] API request wrapper implemented
- [ ] Production build created
- [ ] Tested on physical device
- [ ] All API calls working
- [ ] Login flow working
- [ ] Data loading properly

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

After implementing these fixes:
1. ‚úÖ API calls will work in production builds
2. ‚úÖ Login will function properly
3. ‚úÖ Data will load correctly
4. ‚úÖ No more silent failures
5. ‚úÖ Proper error messages for debugging

## üìû SUPPORT

If issues persist after following this guide:
1. Check the NetworkDebugger component output
2. Review device logs for specific errors
3. Verify backend deployment status
4. Test API endpoints directly with curl

## üèÜ SUCCESS METRICS

Your app should now:
- Load data successfully in production
- Handle login without issues
- Display proper error messages
- Work consistently across all devices

---

**Note:** These fixes address the most common production build connectivity issues. The enhanced error handling and logging will help identify any remaining issues quickly.
